TODO:
=====
T001: Get code in SVN
T002: Start up screen, where the player gets randomly assigned attributes
      and equipment
T003: Draw the exit door/stairs at the end of a level
T004: Make zombies spawning on the current level based on some timer
      so if you finish the previous level quickly, you get more time before
      the "mob" starts spawning

BUGS:
=====
B002: Sometimes zombies still disappear
B004: Zombies are off the map on the left side sometimes

-----------------------------------------------------------
Complete:
=========
B001: Sometimes there are invisible zombies on the map just after the player 
      has killed a zombie 
B003: Targeting ranged weapons is broken
