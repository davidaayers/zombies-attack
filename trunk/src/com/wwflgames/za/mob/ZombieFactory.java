//TODO: Implement this class
//
// It should:
// * spawn random different types of zombies
// * pre-load all of the images in the init, so that spawning a new one
//   doesn't have to throw a slick exception.
// 
// Maybe it should
// * Be aware of different difficulties of zombies and be able to spawn
//   them based on the level the player is on
